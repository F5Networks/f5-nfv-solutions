## About experimental blueprints
F5 Networks partners have created experimental blueprints that you can download and upload into the F5 VNF Manager for automating lifecycle workflows for your BIG-IP VEs as needed by your application. When using any offering in the experimental folder, F5 will NOT provide support. Use these blueprints at your own risk.
