## About the F5 Base solution blueprint

Use the F5 Base solution blueprint for implementing components enabling you to deploy BIG-IP VEs in an open configuration model. No auto-scale and auto-heal functionality exists, but you can run scale and heal workflows, manually. Select this blueprint to create a set of standalone, CGNAT devices in your VIM.
