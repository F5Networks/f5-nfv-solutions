## Inputs for VNFM version 1.1.1

In this folder you have YAML file format for use with the VNF Manager console and JSON file format for use with the REST API. The inputs for this version of VNFM were changed to accommodate the following:

- Additional input parameters enabling you to define an availability zone in OpenStack VIM.
- Fix for the Scaling workflows executed on a layer, preventing the Heal workflow from executing immediately after the new slave is created.
